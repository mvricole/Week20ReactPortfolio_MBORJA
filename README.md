# Week20ReactPortfolio_MBORJA
Updated React portfolio using skills we have learned in this class thus far. 

## Introduction
In this challenge, we were instructed to re-create our portfolios using React and other packages/languages/etc. that we have learned thus far.
Though it is not an easy task, a clean portfolio is important to have when making yourself employable. 
Akin to your resume, the portfolio should demonstrate your skills, eye for design, and knack for writing clean code. 

In this application, you will find a clear user interface, header with image, responsive portfolio buttons and links to my professional LinkedIn and GitHub repository. 


## User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical business' needs:

```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## Before You Start - Downloading Important Packages

Prior to loading the application, please make sure you have all your dependencies installed. This is prompted in your command line using `npm install` or `npm i`

Double check to ensure you have the correct dependencies installed.
This application uses Chakra for user interface. 

## Development Hurdles and Challenges

Learning React has made development extremely engaging and more organized. 
Implementing the use of Chakra UI has also made it fun on a design level. 
However, with any new language, there has been a bit of a learning curve and we bumped into some challenges along the way.

There are still some features I would like to incorporate and will include in future updates to this Repo.
